# About

This contains my solutions to two classes:

1. CS 100.1X: Introduction to Big Data With Apache Spark.
   
   Files belonging to this category are marked by simply `lab` in their names.

2. CS 190.1X: Scalable Machine Learning.

   Files belonging to this category are marked by `ML_lab` in their names.

You will need a working Spark distribution, with Jupiter/iPython installed. It is entirely possible these will not work without the VirtualBox image distributed by the course - if this is the case, please sign up for the course and work from there.

All solutions are guaranteed 100 percent correct. (That's how I got my XSeries Certifice :) )
